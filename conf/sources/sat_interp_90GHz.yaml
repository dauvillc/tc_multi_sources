# Contains various information about the different sources, which can be used
# in the preprocessing scripts.
# Format:
# source:
#   [variables: list]
#   [environment_variables: list]
#   [n_dimensions: int]
#   subsource1:
#    ...
#   subsource2:
#    ...
# - [variables] is a list of str which indicates which netCDF variables should be included
#   for this source. For example,
#   S1: ['TB_10.65V'] indicates that the variable 'TB_10.65V' should be included for the source.
# - [environment_variables]: variables that give information about the spatiotemporal context
#   (e.g. latitude, longitude, month...).
# - n_dimensions gives the number of dimensions of that source (1 for tabular data, 2 for images).
#   A subsource must have n_dimensions specified somewhere in its path. If n_dimensions was specified
#   in a parent source, it will be overwritten by its child's.
# When a source S has subsources, all variables indicated in S will be inherited by the subsources.
# 
# The datasets will look for source S.subclass in the directory 'data/sources/S/subclass'.
