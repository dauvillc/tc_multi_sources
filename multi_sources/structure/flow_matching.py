    some of the sources and trains its backbone to reconstruct the missing data.

    spatiotemporal coordinates.
    The structure expects its input as a dict D {(source_name, index): map},

    (all shapes excluding the batch dimension):
    - "id" is a list of strings of length (B,) each uniquely identifying the elements.
    - "avail" is a scalar tensor of shape (B,) containing 1 if the element is available
        and -1 otherwise.
    - "values" is a tensor of shape (B, C, ...) containing the values of the source.
    - "landmask" is a tensor of shape (B, ...) containing the land-sea mask of the source.
    - "coords" is a tensor of shape (B, 2, ...) containing the spatial coordinates of the source.
    - "dt" is a scalar tensor of shape (B,) containing the time delta between the reference time
        and the element's time, normalized by dt_max.
    - "dist_to_center" is a tensor of shape (B, ...) containing the distance
        to the center of the storm at each pixel, in km.

    The structure outputs a dict {(source_name, index): tensor} containing
