    """Given a torch model which receives inputs from multiple sources, this module masks
    some of the sources and trains its backbone to reconstruct the missing data.
    The sources may have different dimensionalities (e.g. 2D, 1D, 0D) and come with
    spatiotemporal coordinates.
    The structure expects its input as a dict {source_name: map}, where each map contains the
    following key-value pairs (all shapes excluding the batch dimension):
    - "avail" is a scalar tensor of shape (B,) containing 1 if the element is available
        and -1 otherwise.
    - "values" is a tensor of shape (B, C, ...) containing the values of the source.
    - "landmask" is a tensor of shape (B, ...) containing the land-sea mask of the source.
    - "coords" is a tensor of shape (B, 2, ...) containing the spatial coordinates of the source.
    - "dt" is a scalar tensor of shape (B,) containing the time delta between the reference time
        and the element's time, normalized by dt_max.
    - "dist_to_center" is a tensor of shape (B, ...) containing the distance
        to the center of the storm at each pixel, in km.
    The structure outputs a dict {source_name: tensor} containing the predicted values for each source.
